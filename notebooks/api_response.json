We ordered a nice salmon salad for starters. Then we had the chicken mango which was an amazing surprize! The chicken was cooked to perfection, moist and extremely tender. The mango sauce was beyond amazing, it had a very mild spicy kick to it (just enough heat to notice, but not too much to discomfort you bites). The risotto was another story. It takes the trophy this time as one of the best risottos I've had in quite some time! The flavors bombarding your taste buds with every bite, the mushroom gave it the perfect after-taste combined with the zesty creamy finish of the sauce. Not to mention enjoying all of this with the red sea waves crashing next to you as you watch the sunset to the tunes of love from the band",

Even when we complained about our bad experience to them they have said we don\u2019t know how we can help you. Sorry I would not recommend this place for anybody. Even one star is a lot for them.

The restaurant was quite busy even on a weekday morning, but the service was still good. I ordered the grilled lamb chops for lunch in and it was superb. The combination of flavours gave me a foodgasm. Had the chocolate Mont Blanc to takeaway as well because even though I was already stuffed, I had to give the signature pastry a try but I found it way too sweet for my liking. If you have a real sweet tooth, go for it! I enjoyed the chestnut cream vermicelli but when I got to the meringue base, it tasted like diabetes.",
